The aim of this project is to create a fully autonomous rc car using a Raspberry Pi linked to a PC based computer vision algorithm. I believe that this is the best 
solution becuase it allows the immense processing power required by AI systems to be offloaded onto a more powerful PC, while the Raspberry Pi can focus on real time 
awareness and crash prevention using more primative sensors such as ultrasonic sensors and potentially GPS.

Currently this project is still in the early stages. I took an old radio controlled car from my childhood, and fitted it out with a Raspberry Pi, power systems, 
ultrasonic sensors, and a camera system with pan and tilt control. Then I used python to implement remote control of the vehicle over wifi, using a Playstation 
controller as the input device. I also got the video signal from the pi to be streamed back to the host PC, so I am able to drive the car out of my line of sight. 

I plan to keep working on this project once I finish yr12, hopefully implementing automation sometime in the future.
